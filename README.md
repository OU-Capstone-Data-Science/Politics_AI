## Introduction
* Purpose
	* This capstone project tackels a very important issue; the American people are under-informed about government and politics. When it is time for an election, media sources contradict each other, politicians contradict each other, and the American people form their political opinions based around their lifestyle and personal values. Everyone's vote counts the same, and unless the American people begin to do more political research, votes will be cast in ways that may contradict the individual's beliefs, or votes may not be cast at all.

* Solution Overview
	* Our capstone provides tools to help the American people learn more about active political candidates in an easy and fun way. Our project is a deployment of a webapp within a website (listed as <www.politech.xyz>). This webapp has 5 unique tabs, and each tab helps provide different insight into the politcal spectrum revolving around presidential candidates and social media.

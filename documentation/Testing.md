# Unit Tests
Unit tests for our project will be done by importing Python unittest. The unittest unit testing framework was originally inspired by JUnit and has a similar flavor as major unit testing frameworks in other languages. It supports test automation, sharing of setup and shutdown code for tests, aggregation of tests into collections, and independence of the tests from the reporting framework. This will be used in our project to ensure our web application is able to be ran.
